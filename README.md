# Statistics Assignments (R)

This repository contains my **weekly statistics assignments**, coded in **R**, as part of my university coursework. The assignments involve various statistical techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, data visualization, and more.

The following PDFs contain the results and write-ups of each assignment. In addition, you will find the corresponding R scripts that I used to generate the analyses.

## R Scripts

Each assignment also includes an associated **R script** (`.R` files), which you can find in this repository. These scripts contain the code used to produce the analysis, graphs, and results presented in the PDFs.

To run the scripts locally, please follow the instructions below:
